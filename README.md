# Simple Truffle-React Project

This is a project made for easy understanding of how to build a React frontend for Solidity contracts in a minimal way. It is loosely based on the [React Truffle Box](https://github.com/truffle-box/react-box), but I found even that to be too much boilerplate.

Nevertheless, have a look at the commit history to see how things work for yourself.
